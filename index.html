        <strong>“Prithvi Narayan Inter College” </strong> ,starting <br> with 13 students and 2 teachers for 
        intermediate education. The beginning classes were conducted in<b> Kanya 
        School, Nadipur Patan</b> and moved to Bhimkali Patan in Bagar after two 
        years. <br>
        &emsp;&emsp; &emsp;The college resumed its first batch on<b> 20 August 1963 </b>with the <b>Bachelor of 
        Arts (BA)</b> study, which was accredited from <strong>Tribhuvan University.</strong> The 
        college was formally incorporated with Tribhuvan University <br> on <b><i>1 Shrawan 2030 BS</i></b>
          as one of its constituent campuses, changing its status from ‘college 
        to ‘campus’. <br> The campus started its master’s degree in Economics in 2035 
        BS. It was followed by MA in Geography the following year in <b> 2036<i>BS</i></b>. Now, 
        the campus has more than 18 master’s courses <br>in different subjects.
        The campus now has<u> 29 departments</u> and runs more than <u>34 academic 
        programmes</u> and offers about 500 courses in<i> humanities & social sciences, 
        management, education, law and science.</i> <br> There are 504 faculty and 116 
        non-teaching staff who have involved in providing higher education to more 
        than <b>8,007</b> students.
        The campus places a high priority on creating an environment that enables <br>
        teaching and non-teaching staff to perform their best job. The campus 
        appreciates the contributions of all its faculty members in making the
