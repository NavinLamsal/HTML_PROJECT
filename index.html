          as one of its constituent campuses, changing its status from ‘college 
        to ‘campus’. <br> The campus started its master’s degree in Economics in 2035 
        BS. It was followed by MA in Geography the following year in <b> 2036<i>BS</i></b>. Now, 
        the campus has more than 18 master’s courses <br>in different subjects.
        The campus now has<u> 29 departments</u> and runs more than <u>34 academic 
        programmes</u> and offers about 500 courses in<i> humanities & social sciences, 
        management, education, law and science.</i> <br> There are 504 faculty and 116 
        non-teaching staff who have involved in providing higher education to more 
        than <b>8,007</b> students.
        The campus places a high priority on creating an environment that enables <br>
